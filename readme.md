# Cp-snippets

This is an open source project. It contains a collection of boiler plate code for competative programming contest such as Google-kickstart, codejam, codeforces-contest, codechef-contest, etc. 

## Motivation for the project 

* Have you ever given a contest ? Find some common code in every problem (like input, output, header files)? 
* Getting bored writing this code again and again every time ?
* Wanna save a few minutes in writing a contest and improve your rank drastically ?

I hope you can gain some insights from this repo and use it for yourself on your cp journey.
