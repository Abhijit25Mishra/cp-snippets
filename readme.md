# Cp-snippets

This is an open-source project. It contains a collection of boilerplate code for competitive programming contests such as kickstart, code jam, CodeForces-contest, CodeChef-contest, etc. 

## Motivation for the project 

* Have you ever given a contest? Find some common code in every problem (like input, output, header files). 
* Getting bored writing this code, again and again, every time?
* Wanna save a few minutes writing a contest and drastically improve your rank?

I hope you can gain some insights from this repo and use it for yourself on your cp journey.
If you feel I have missed out on some important things, be sure to create an issue. And feel free to share your knowledge.
